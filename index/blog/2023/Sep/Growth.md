## Why not: Jack of all trades, master of one, or two, or three, maybe four? Maybe more?

I'm not sure where this mentality came from, or who has been pushing its narrative over the years, but want to address this once and for all in the article.

Since time in memorium, the idea that someone, or something tends to be a "jack of all trades, master or none" has been the mentality for years. And we often just accept it, like life really is that binary.

I can remember the first instance I experienced something along those lines, at least professionally. I studied tourism management and consultancy. Unlike every other student at the time, I opted to go into hotels as a first stop in the working-world of adulthood.
What surprised me is how many people were shocked by this.
"Wait, you studied tourism, **_and don't_** want to work for an airline or a travel agent!?"

Since the last 2 years of being a freelancer, it's a box I often peer into, as I take on new contracts and clients, get added into team's rotations, or simply get to watch from the free-~~lancer~~lines.

What I've come to learn over the years is that the (mis?)-labelling and misrepresentation of generalists vs specialists comes down to one thing and one thing alone.

It comes down to management. Not being able to utilize people who 'get shit done' is a strategic error, while not being able to exploit people's talents who look at the broader picture is a tactical one. 

Warriors going small-ball to win games? Strategy. Alternate between resting Curry and Klay during a game? Tactics. I myself have issues avoiding the "jack of all trade" trap. I should think the key to one's own growth is to recognize their strengths and be ok with it. And if you tend to have a strong interest in something else and can get paid for it, then you're more diverse. 

To quote Chat Holmes' brilliant book The Ultimate Sales Machine:

>> ... there are three types of executives. A full 90% are what I call 'tactical executives', while 9% are 'strategic'. 
>
>> ... tactical executives don't understand strategy. If you tell them that it's twice as hard today as it was 10 years ago to get an appointment with a with a prospect, they will think of ways to make the sales team work twice as hard. 
>
>> ... and only 1% - the most effective executives - possess the rare combintation of both tactical and strategic abilities.
