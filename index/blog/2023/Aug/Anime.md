## Anime is a cool thing and this is why

It's one of the few arts where there's a convergence of nearly all things I like, packed into a colorful knock-out punch that looks like Pikachu and hits like iron-Mike.

I never started to think about it until recently, but anime, for me and many others, serves as a divergent point at which often, tech, style and swagger, nostalgia, the depths of nerd-dom, and generally just-cool-things, all get crammed into Japanese-fueled story-telling, visuals, music and culture. 

Being an African kid - that is, born and raised in Zimbabwe (simuka Zimbabwe!), one might think we're a decent bit removed from watching Japanese "cartoons"*. But dragonball knows no countries, understands all languages and transcends the very nature of humans....

Ok, it's not that dramatic. But it can be. And do watch the maturity ratings - they joketh not. 

If you don't know how to feel about all this, check out Afro Samurai and Saumari Champoloo (must for hip-hop-heads/nerds). 
They are a bit over-the-top, but if you come into it with a level-head, that might be a taste of what's in store.

Chill, tech-nerd stuff? Summer Wars. Un-chill, tech-nerd stuff? Ghost in the Shell, Serial Experiments Lain [nerd-bonus]. Time travel and pysi-ops? Steins;Gate. Space adventures with a 90's vibe? Cowboy Bebop. Thriller, mastermind shit? Deathnote. Crazy wtf-did-I-just-watch-it-was-so-crazy-ness? Akira, Devilman Crybaby, Ninja Scroll, Black Lagoon, Berserk. GoT but with Vikings and, just, Japanese? Viking Saga. Chillax, inclusionary stuff? Sailor Moon and Jo-Jo's. 

List goes on. There's things for people who ~really~ like food, awesome 90's dope-vibes-sports anime like Slam Dunk - there's something for everyone. 

Just doooo it. 

*N.B I won't address the cartoons thing - it's been covered. I just had to make this note to note that you've noted this.
