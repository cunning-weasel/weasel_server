# An ode to gaming, and the tech that drive it\n\n

I've always been a huge gamer. I credit it as the number one reason I even became a software developer. 

It's a passion that I've become more of a philosopher, fan and critique of since my first days booting up prince of persia on a dos machine as a 5 year old in '95.
